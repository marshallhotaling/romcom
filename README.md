# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

### > So we created a program that lets you combine an image, a title, and two descriptors into a randomized (and fabricated) romance novel covers. If you wanted to create your own, we have coded functionality for that as well and what's more, you can save those and randomized covers for future viewing!

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

### > 1. Fork and clone this Repo: git@github.com:marshallhotaling/romcom.git
### > 2. Open VS code and type open index.html to open the app in chrome.
### > 3. Interact with the app!

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### > Here: assets/For Picture Qestion.png
### > I don't know about coolest but we figured out how to add an entire HTML article to the DOM without touching the HTML file and we were able to add a double click code that makes the article it's own event listener for the delete functionality!

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

### > We had about 6 days to work on it and I'd say we spent about; 2-3 hours everyday and then maybe 6 hours on saturday. We are just at the end of our second week.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

### > So the goals were to write clean JS, mess with the connection between JS, CSS, and HTML; and write code collaboratively. We definitly did all those things! We coded in VS code and pushed our work up through GitHub (obviously) and stayed in contact throughout the process.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

### > I am very happy that I was able to figure out how to add HTML to the HTML document through JS and have it display correctly based on the CSS styling!! gave me a much better understanding of targeting different elements in different ways! I was also blown away by the fact that you can make something it's own listener in order to have it execute code, that huge!!
